# TCWT: Temporal Curvature Wave Theory

An exploration of the Timewave as a gravitational phenomenon, focusing on the 2112 Breach and the engineering of the "Hard-Snag" ballast.

## Core Breakthroughs (March 2026)
- **The Ghost Threshold:** Located the Landau Pole at $t=101$, the point where un-damped temporal complexity becomes unphysical.
- **The Hard-Snag Engine:** Successfully derived a damping function that plateaus topological tension, preventing "spaghettification" during the Breach.
- **Photon Resilience:** Proven that Abelian gauge invariance survives the transition, ensuring information coherence in the post-2112 era.
