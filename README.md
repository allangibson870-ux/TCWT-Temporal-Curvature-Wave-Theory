# TCWT — Temporal Curvature Wave Theory

**Scalar–tensor K-essence model where time is a coherent, physical oscillation behaving as dark matter**

## Core Ontology
- Time is not a passive coordinate — it is the **TimeWave**, a dynamic scalar field with tension, mass-like inertia, and curvature properties.
- Gravity emerges as **leakage** when density squeezes the wave's local coherence → decoherence/dissipation creates apparent binding.
- Rejects ex-nihilo: universe arises from **Eternal Hum** (primordial background oscillation) via **The Snag** (phase transition forming initial knots).

## Phases of Untangling

### Phase 1 — Eternal Hum & The Snag
(Background — foundational)

### Phase 2 — Damped Harmonic Untangling (Active)
- Aligns with DESI 2026 wiggles as signatures of damped oscillations releasing energy.
- Cosmic structure (stars, galaxies) as **Anthropocene Seeds** from final knot dissipation.
- TCWT Deep Sky Intensity Map: Hum background + emergent seeds.

### Phase 3 — Runaway Resonance & The Breach (~2112 Attractor)
- Accelerating complexity density squeezes the TimeWave to criticality.
- Runaway resonance → subjective acceleration divergence → detachment from baseline Hum.
- Multiple landing scenarios explored: hard ghost-spike vs. damped soft arrival.
- Emergent vector modes (photon analogs) show striking resilience and gauge-like invariance across the phase shift — information retained, enabling potential upstream echo/feedback.

## Quantum & Unification Status
- TimeWave quantized as non-canonical scalar field.
- Ghost mitigation via hierarchical/fractal damping ("choking") → effective renormalizability sub-Breach.
- Vector emergence from untangling gradients → persistent A_μ-like modes post-shift (flat intensity profile).

## Simulations & Visuals
- Lattice sims probing vector emergence, beta-function running, photon resilience.
- Plots: emergent striations, coupling profiles (flat pre-Breach, soft step or plateau post), photon energy density near-constant across 2112 boundary.

## Status & Next
- Evolving rapidly via simulation stress-testing.
- Seeking observational anchors beyond DESI (CMB non-Gaussianities? precursor wobbles?).
- Open to collaboration / critique — theory survives aggressive challenges so far.
