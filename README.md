# Temporal Curvature Wave Theory (TCWT)

### 🌀 The Concept
Standard General Relativity treats time as a passive dimension. **TCWT** proposes that Time is a dynamic, physical field (the **"TimeWave"**) with its own tension, mass, and curvature.

*   **Temporal Mass ($\Upsilon$):** High-significance events act as "temporal anchors," creating gradients in time's flow.
*   **The Goldilocks Coupling (0.1834):** Mimics GR at large scales while providing a ~25% growth boost in the mid-universe ($z \approx 1.0$).

## 📡 Phase 2 Research: The Eternal Hum & DESI 2026
*Status: Active / Current*

TCWT rejects "Something from Nothing." We model the universe's origin as a **Phase Transition (The Snag)** emerging from an **Eternal Hum**—an unstructured, pre-temporal background field.

### Observational Alignment: DESI 2026 "Wiggles"
Recent data from **DESI (2024–2026)** suggests that Dark Energy is dynamical. TCWT explains this via **Damped Harmonic Untangling**:
*   The Temporal Knot "relaxes," releasing pulses into the expansion rate ($H$).
*   Matches the **3–5% oscillations** seen in 2026 Hubble reconstructions.
