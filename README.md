TCWT: Temporal Curvature Wave Theory
Conceptual Architect: allangibson870-ux
🌌 Executive Summary: The Universe as a Temporal Wave
Temporal Curvature Wave Theory (TCWT) proposes a fundamental shift in cosmology: Time is not a passive coordinate, but a physical, oscillating field (
) that curves the fabric of reality.
Instead of searching for undiscovered particles (Dark Matter) or unexplained forces (Dark Energy), TCWT reinterprets these phenomena as "ripples" and "flows" within this universal temporal field.
Dark Matter as a Temporal Ripple: What we perceive as "invisible mass" is actually a phase-offset in the 
 field. These oscillations support ultralight modes that exert gravitational pull without interacting with light.
Dark Energy as Temporal Flow: The steady evolution of the field drives the accelerated expansion of the universe, acting as a natural Cosmological Constant driven by the field's potential energy.
Stability: The theory is formalised within the Horndeski/DHOST class to ensure mathematical stability and consistency with the GW170817 speed-of-gravity observations.
🛠 Technical Framework: Scalar–Tensor Formalisation
TCWT is treated as a scalar–tensor model with a constrained kinetic structure, ensuring 
 remains within the Horndeski/DHOST class to avoid higher‑derivative ghosts. If 
 depends only on 
, the field equations remain second‑order and the theory stays stable under perturbations. This provides a consistent foundation for interpreting 
 as the generator of physical time rather than as a modification of 
.
1. Background Evolution & Energy Density
On an FRW background with 
, the effective energy density and pressure of the temporal field are:


Depending on the potential, the field can behave as stiff matter, quintessence, or a cosmological‑constant‑like component. If 
 is small, then 
 supports ultralight oscillations that act as a cold, pressureless component, similar to Axion-like Dark Matter. Phase‑offset modes contribute to 
 without electromagnetic coupling, providing a route to modelling dark‑matter‑like behaviour.
2. Linearised Perturbations
The linearised equation around a homogeneous background is:

where 
 encodes the nonminimal coupling. Depending on 
, the scalar mode can experience enhanced damping or modified sound speed, which could leave signatures in structure formation or address 
-level tensions.
3. Gravitational Wave Constraints
For gravitational waves, the effective metric 
 modifies the propagation speed and dispersion relation. The tensor equation becomes:

Spatial gradients in 
 lead to frequency‑dependent phase shifts or small deviations from luminal propagation. Observations from GW170817 constrain deviations in 
 to below 
, so any viable 
 must reduce to GR in regimes where 
 is nearly constant.
📐 Theoretical Constraints
The development of TCWT is guided by the standard scalar–tensor requirements:
Avoiding Ghosts: Ensuring the kinetic terms remain positive-definite.
Gradient Stability: Preventing exponential growth of small-scale fluctuations.
Equivalence Principle: Preserving the weak equivalence principle and matching PPN bounds from solar‑system tests.
The idea is presented as a scalar‑field framework structured to be formalised and compared with existing scalar–tensor and emergent‑time approaches.
