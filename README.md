# Temporal Curvature Wave Theory (TCWT)
**Model Verification: The 0.18 Goldilocks Coupling**

This repository contains the numerical implementation and cosmological verification of the **Temporal Curvature Wave Theory (TCWT)**, built on the `hi_class` (Horndeski in CLASS) engine.

## 🚀 Key Discovery: The Goldilocks Zone
Our simulations have identified a unique coupling constant of **0.1834** that bridges the gap between standard General Relativity and early-universe growth anomalies.

### Observational Signature: Euclid Residual Test
The plot below demonstrates that at a coupling of **0.20**, the TCWT model remains mathematically stable and effectively "indistinguishable" from standard Einstein gravity within the 1% precision limit of the **ESA Euclid Satellite**.

## 📁 Project Structure
*   **[project_contents/](project_contents/)**: Contains the C++ source code, Makefile, and the [archived_results/](project_contents/archived_results/) from our high-precision simulations.
*   **[configs/](configs/)**: Standard and "Breaking Point" .ini files for the `class` engine.

## 📊 Summary of Results
*   **Age of Universe:** 13.81 Gyr (Matches Planck)
*   **Growth Boost:** ~25% at redshift z=1.0 (Potential JWST alignment)
*   **Stability:** Confirmed up to Upsilon = 0.20 using `x_functions` solver.
