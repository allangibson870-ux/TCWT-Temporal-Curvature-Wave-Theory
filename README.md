# Temporal Curvature Wave Theory (TCWT)

### 🌀 The Concept
Standard General Relativity treats time as a passive dimension. **TCWT** proposes that Time is a dynamic, physical field (the **"TimeWave"**) with its own tension, mass, and curvature.

## 📡 Phase 2: The Eternal Hum & DESI 2026
*Status: Active / Current*

TCWT rejects "Something from Nothing." We model the universe's origin as a **Phase Transition (The Snag)** emerging from an **Eternal Hum**.

### 1. Observational Alignment: DESI 2026 "Wiggles"
Recent data from **DESI (2024–2026)** suggests that Dark Energy is dynamical. TCWT explains this via **Damped Harmonic Untangling**.

### 2. The TCWT Deep Sky
The **Intensity Map** visualizes the "Eternal Hum" background and the "Anthropocene Seeds" (star/galaxy clusters) emerging from the knot's final dissipation.
