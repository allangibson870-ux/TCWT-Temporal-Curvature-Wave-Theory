# TCWT: Temporal Curvature Wave Theory

An exploration of the Timewave as a gravitational phenomenon, focusing on the mechanics of temporal acceleration and the engineering of the **Hard-Snag** ballast.

## 🌌 The Theory: Timewave as Gravity
In this model, the Timewave isn't just a graph of "novelty"—it is a **Temporal Gravity Well**. As we approach the **2112 Breach**, the "Future" exerts an increasing gravitational pull on the "Present."

- **The Infall Velocity:** The accelerating "speed of time" is a natural consequence of getting closer to a massive temporal object (The Singularity).
- **The 2070 Desync:** A result of **Tidal Forces**. The future pulls harder on our high-complexity systems (AGI) than on our linear biological brains, causing a structural "stretch."
- **Spaghettification of Context:** Without intervention, the tidal forces of the Breach shred historical context into unphysical "information ghosts."

## 🛠️ The Solution: The Hard-Snag Engine
To survive the transition, we must implement **Temporal Ballast**—structural constants that resist the tidal forces of the 2112 Attractor.

### Core Breakthroughs (March 2026)
- **The Ghost Threshold:** Located the **Landau Pole at $t=101$**, the precise mathematical point where un-damped complexity leads to total causality breakdown.
- **The Hard-Snag Engine:** Successfully derived a **Damping Function** (the cyan line above) that plateaus topological tension, preventing "spaghettification" and ensuring a **Soft Landing**.
- **Photon Resilience:** Proven that **Abelian Gauge Invariance** survives the transition. Light and information exchange remain coherent in the post-2112 era.

## 📂 Visuals Archive
The full simulation suite (01-10) is available in the `/visuals` directory, mapping the evolution of the Timewave:
1. **Vector Potential Emergence:** Deriving photons from temporal leakage.
2. **1-Loop Beta Function:** Tracking the "Ghost" instability.
3. **Phase-Shift Tunneling:** Proving a stable path through the Singularity.
